      "message": "This looks really like a brute force approach. It will build all .txt files and, for presentations, it will build most of them twice!\n\nFor example git-gerrit-workshop.txt consists mostly of include statements. Every included file will be built once when it is hit by this loop and second time when the git-gerrit-workshop.txt is built (because it is included). We only need to build it when it is included from the git-gerrit-workshop.txt. In other words, we don\u0027t need, and don\u0027t want, to explicitly build the included files.",
