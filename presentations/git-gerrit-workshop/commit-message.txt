Commit Message
--------------

----
First line is header, shall be shorter than 70 chars

Separate the body from the header by an empty line. The commit message
should describe why you are doing the change. That's what typically helps
best to understand what the change is all about. The details of what you
changed are visible from the file diffs.

Body can be as many paragraphs as you want, shouldn't exceed width of 80
chars. This helps command line tools to render it nicely. Paragraphs are
separated by empty lines.

Bug: NGP-123 is rendered as a hyperlink to jtrack
