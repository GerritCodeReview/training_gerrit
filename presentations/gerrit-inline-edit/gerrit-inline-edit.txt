== Inline Edit in Gerrit

== Overview

* Motivation
* Design
* Create new change
* Edit change
* Review change edit
* Change edit actions
* Finding change edits
* Uploading change edits
* Customize inline editor
* Future work

== Motivation

* Allow to modify repository content directly in browser
* Low barrier to contribute to a project
* As a change owner: Address reviewer comments
* As a reviewier: Fix the patch directly in browser and shorten
+
comment, wait and re-review loop
+
* As project administrator: Edit Gerrit project configuration directly in browser

== Design

* Inline changes are done in context of a change
* Multiple files can be modified in context of a change edit:
+
no "one modification -- one commit" limitation
+
* Regular patch sets are stored on ref:
+
`refs/changes/CC/CCCC/P` where
+
`CC/CCCC` is sharded representation of change number
+
* Change edits are stored in special ref:
+
`refs/users/UU/UUUU/edit-CCCC/P` where
+
`UU/UUUU` is sharded representation of user account,
+
`CCCC` is change number and
+
`P` is the patch set number it is based on
+
* There is max. one edit per user per change
* Change edit can be deleted or published and promoted to regular patch set
* When change edit is based on non-current patch set, it must be rebased

== Creating a New Draft Change

* It is not necessary to clone the whole repository to make trivial changes
* There are two different ways to create an empty change:
