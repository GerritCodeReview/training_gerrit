== New Submit Type `Rebase If Necessary`
The 'Rebase If Necessary' submit type automatically rebases the

commit is added as a new patch set to the change.

== Branch specific Submit Types
The submit type for changes can now be controlled from Prolog. This
enables branch specific submit types. E.g. for devlopment branches the
submit type can be `Merge If Necessary` while for release branches it
is `Fast Forward Only`.
