== Auto-Merge on Push

Teams that want to use Gerritâ€™s submit strategies to handle contention
on busy branches can use `%submit` to create a change and have it
link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/user-upload.html#auto_merge[
immediately submitted], if the caller has Submit permission on
`refs/for/<ref>`.


== Project specific configuration

It is now possible to define
link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/config-gerrit.html#_a_id_commentlink_a_section_commentlink[
commentlinks] and
link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/config-themes.html[
themes] on project level.

== Sticky approvals for review labels

Review labels can now be configured so that the highest possible
positive value for the label is copied forward when a new patch set is
uploaded. This is done by setting
link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/config-labels.html#label_copyMaxScore[
copyMaxScore] on the label.

== REST API

Several new

REST API endpoints] were added.
