== Push a Change to Gerrit
In this exercise you will learn how to push a change to the Gerrit
code review system.

=== Preparation

* Make sure you configured the push to Gerrit in your local Git
  repository as described in the exercise
  link:configure-push-to-gerrit.html[Configure Push to Gerrit].
* Create a new local branch starting from the 'origin/master' branch
  and create one new commit in that branch. Make sure the
  'Compute Change-Id for Gerrit Code Review' button in the commit
  dialog is selected when you commit the changes. This will create
  the 'Change-Id: ...' footer in the commit message which is necessary
  for the Gerrit Code Review.

'I0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' is just a placeholder for
the Change-Id. The actual Change-Id will be generated and inserted on
commit.

=== Pushing to Gerrit
Right click the Git repository node in the Git Repositories view and
chose the 'Push to Upstream' command from the context menu:

After the change is pushed the confirmation dialog will appear:

From the confirmation dialog we see the URL under which the change is
exposed in Gerrit. We also see that the numerical ID of the change is
'127485' in this case.

=== Check your Change in Gerrit

* Copy the link from the confirmation dialog to the clipboard and
  paste into you web browser

* *OR* simply open
  link:https://<gerrit-host>/#/q/status:open,n,z[Gerrit] in
  your web browser and find your change in the list of open changes.
  Usually, it is the one on the top as the entries are sorted by time
  of last update. Click on the change to get to the change details.

* Get familiar with the information Gerrit displays on the change
  page. The change contains one patch set on its creation. A patch set
  corresponds to one Git commit.
* Click on a file to see the Side-by-Side diff.

'Q:' Compare the local commit SHA1 and the SHA1 of the Patch Set 1.
Are they the same?
