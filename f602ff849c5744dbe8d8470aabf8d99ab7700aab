[1] says that this indicates whether an alternate access method such as an access control list applies to the file. I have no idea what exactly this means and how to change it, but it may be related to this problem. At least I can\u0027t see any other thing which is special about this file.\n\n[1] http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2007-09/msg00459.html",
